1) 	a. 1-7
	b. 7-15, 19-27
	c. 16-18, since this round is between two AIMD rounds and the cwnd is between 72 and cwnd/2 (36).
	d. The segment loss is due to a triple duplicate ack because if a timeout happened, the size of the congestion window would drop at 1 MSS.
	e. The segment loss is due to a timeout since the size of the congestion window dropped to 1 MSS.
	f. 64 kb; initial value of ssthresh
	g. 36; 72/2 because AIMD is transitioning to fast recovery.
	h. 36; because it stays the same as fast recovery transitions to the second AIMD.
	i. 22; 44/2 (peak of round 27 divided by 2) because AIMD is ending.
	j. 5th round: 1+2+4+8+16 = 31 segments 
	6th round: 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63 segments
	So the 61st segment is transmitted at the 6th round.

2) 	a. Hardware queues always process packets using FIFO as a queuing discipline.
	b. FIFO is inadequate when you need to give preference to high-priority traffic such as VOIP.
	c. When the hardware queues need to prioritize some traffic, they can use some form of software queuing. 
	d. These three 3-bit IP Precedence Values can prioritize traffic: 000 - Routine or Best Effort, 001 - Priority, 101 - Critical

3)	All subnets have the prefix 223.1.17/24 as stated by the question.
	Subnet 1: 223.1.17.0/25; this subnet needs to support 70 interfaces, so we just need a block of 128 addresses; so we need to fix 25 bits in order to have 2^7 addresses. 
	Subnet 2: 223.1.17.128/26; this subnet needs to support 60 interfaces, so we just need a block of 64 addresses; so we need to fix 26 bits in order to have 2^6 addresses. 
	Subnet 3: 223.1.17.192/26; this subnet needs to support 60 interfaces, so we just need a block of 64 addresses; so we need to fix 26 bits in order to have 2^6 addresses. 

	From Subnet 1, we have ip addresses: 223.1.17.0 to 223.1.17.127 = 128 addresses.
	From Subnet 2, we have addresses: 223.1.17.128 to 223.1.17.191 = 64 addresses.
	From Subnet 3, we have: 223.1.17.192 to 223.1.17.255 = 64 addresses.
